				<h2> What is "Mario Bross"?</h2>
				<p> Mario Bross is a 1983 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for arcades.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3> It was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo's chief engineer. Italian twin brother plumbers Mario and Luigi exterminate creatures, like turtles (Shellcreepers) and crabs emerging from the sewers by knocking them upside-down and kicking them away. The Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System version is the first game to be developed by Intelligent Systems. It is part of the Mario franchise, but originally began as a spin-off from the Donkey Kong series.</h3>
